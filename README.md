# 仕事 - Shigoto
![Shigoto Logo](https://paulglushak.com/flag-shigoto.png)

*Shigoto* is a minimalistic [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) parser and manager. It was created as a personal tool to try and get used to organizing tasks properly in a bloat-free manner.

## What it doesn't have
- Sorting is currently broken.
- Code is most likely not optimized.
- Not ready for mobile yet.
- **Something else? [let me know](https://todo.sr.ht/~hxii/shigoto)!**

## What it has
- Reads and parses todo.txt.
- Filtering based on project, context and priority.
- Archiving (done.txt) and marking as done.
- Password protected. (TBD)

## Usage
1. Set hashed password in `config.php` using BCrypt.
2. Copy and paste your `todo.txt` file in the same folder as Shigoto. (if you don't have one, an empty file will be created)

## Notes
- This was created as a personal project, so basically everything is an afterthought.
- This is supposed to be minimalistic, but I tried covering the basics. If you think something basic is missing, let me know!
- This code in this project is far from ideal, but I'm getting better.
